1.	TO DO			Objc app needs to query the python proxy to get the list of new requests.
					This can be done by sending an HTTP GET request to http://localhost:15800/new-requests/
	
	STATUS			Incomplete		
	
	
2.	INVESTIGATE		I am concerned what happens in iTunes if new tracks are added to the library while the person
					is DJing. I do not believe the "Track ID" numbers remain consistent if the library is updated
					with new songs.
					
					However, I notice that there is a <key>Persistent ID</key> in the iTunes XML DB.
					
					Should we be using this ID instead of what is found in the Track ID field???
					
					Is it possible to add the correct track in iTunes (with your little applescript) using this
					Persistent ID instead of the regular Track ID??
	
	RESULT			?
	
	
3.	INVESTIGATE		We need a way to store configuration variables that can be read/written by both the objc app
					and python.
					
					*IDEA* Use one of those .plist files?  Both ObjC and Python can read those.
					
					Example configutation data:
						serverPort
						maxRequests_UserPerHour
						maxRequests_ArtistPerHour
						maxRequests_AlbumPerHour
					
					*IDEA* Perhaps the GUI could have a "Config" pane/tab where one could enter this information?
						The ObjC app would then write these options to .plist config file.
					
					The python app could either periodically poll the config file to see if it has changed, or the ObjC
					app could send some kind of command to the proxy server like an HTTP GET request to
						http://localhost:15800/reload-config/
					whenever the config options are changed.
						
	RESULT			?
		
		
4.	INVESTIGATE		Can we investigate if there is a way to pull information from iTunes about the song that is
					currently playing?
					
					Also, is there a way to pull from iTunes a list of tracks that have recently been played?
					Say I want to know "What where the last 10 tracks played in iTunes" so that I can display
					this information on the website.
